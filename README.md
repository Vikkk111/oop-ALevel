OOp Principles A Level 

### Task 1 - This is the very first Task 

Students are required to Use pseudocode to write a class with relevant attributes and methods to represent a digital clock object. It should represent the time as a 24 hour clock, and include methods to: create a new object, set the time manually, display the time, and update the time at the end of each minute.
![Task 1 Pseudo Algorithm](oop_Task1_Clock.png)

### Extension
- Add functionality so that the clock automatically displays from the starting minute and hour
- Add functionality so that the clock now has changing seconds.

### Task 2 - OOP Programming Activity 1 - The Bank Task

This Activity uses Skeleton code [OOP_Activity1_Skeleton_Code](OOP_Activity1_skeleton_Code.py) is part of a program that allows a user to create a bank account, login to their account, check their balance and deposit or withdraw money from their account. 

It defines an account class, that stores information about the 

individual bank accounts, and a Bank class, that holds all of the Bank accounts and performs operations on individual accounts when asked to by the user.  
 
Add the missing attributes and method logic to the Activity 1 Skeleton Code to complete its functionality. No changes should be made to main, no new methods should be defined, and the parameters that the methods use should not be changed, deleted or added to.
